In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/* How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs */

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. */
 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? */

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

/*or*/

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

/*or*/

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

/*or*/

SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

/* What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products). */

SELECT distinct sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/* Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? */

SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/* How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? */

SELECT count(distinct acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust 
ON Feb.OrderID = Cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. */

SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
