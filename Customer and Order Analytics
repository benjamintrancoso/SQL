In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/* How many orders were placed in January? */

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* How many of those orders were for an iPhone? */

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. */
 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? */

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

/* Or */

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

/* Or */

SELECT distinct product, MIN(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1;

/* Or */

SELECT product, min(price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

/* What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? */

SELECT distinct sum(quantity)*price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/* Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold? What was the total revenue? */

SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/* How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? */

SELECT count(distinct acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust 
ON Feb.OrderID = Cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

/* List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. */

SELECT product, sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

/* Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? */

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)

AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2;

/* How many of each type of headphone were sold in February? */

SELECT Product,sum(quantity) AS quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

/* What was the average amount spent per account in February? */

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum) AS avg_amount_per_acct
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=Cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/* Or */

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

/* What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? */

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum) AS avg_product_quantity_per_acc
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

/* Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total? */

SELECT distinct product, quantity*price as total_revenue
